# 🧭 Taif University Guide - Web Project

This project was developed as part of a **team assignment** for the **Internet Technologies course** at **Taif University**.

I was responsible for designing and developing the **main pages and core logic** of the site using **Visual Studio Code**, including:

- HTML structure  
- CSS styling  
- JavaScript interactivity  
- PHP backend connectivity  

The idea of the project is to create an **interactive university guide** website to help students at Taif University easily navigate and find important resources and services.
